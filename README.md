This is a simple web-based Employee Form application developed using HTML, Bootstrap 4, and jQuery. It simulates checking if an employee exists in the database and allows you to create, update, and reset employee information.

Features
Dynamic Form Handling: The form fields and buttons are dynamically enabled or disabled based on the employee ID input.
Simulated Database Check: The application simulates checking if an employee ID exists in a database and populates the form accordingly.
Form Validation: Basic form validation to ensure all fields are filled before saving or updating employee data.
Reset Functionality: Resets the form and disables all fields.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web page.
Bootstrap 4: For styling and layout of the form.
jQuery: For handling form interactions, validation, and dynamic updates.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-form.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser to view and interact with the form.

The Employee ID field controls the form behavior:

If the ID doesn't exist in the simulated database, the user can fill in the form and save the data.
If the ID exists, the form is populated with existing employee data, and the user can update or reset it.
Buttons:

Save: Saves new employee data.
Change: Updates existing employee data.
Reset: Clears the form and resets all fields.
Simulated Database Behavior
The script simulates a database with two employee IDs: 101 and 102.
When an existing ID is entered, the form is populated with dummy data for editing.
Example Employee Data
For employee ID 101, the form will be auto-populated with the following data:

Name: John Doe
Salary: 50000
HRA: 10000
DA: 5000
Deduction: 2000
